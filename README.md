# DataScience-Capstone-2
Data Science for Capstone 2 Project
this is a found solution that was full of bugs, missing or incorrect imports and functions 
and required 
a large amount of debugging and enviroment preparation 
with trial an error, the MNIST library and some ingenuity, the machine vision hand written text recogintion program achieved 97% accuracy but Tensorflow must be opitmized with exact 2.01 standards, 
python 3 and the correct versions of mnist and nist.

1. Download all files and request data files.
2. Install all libaries and dependencies, there are alot, from Keras to MaxPooling please carefully install all libaries
3. both on your local computer and within your ide environment(don't know why)
4. once reviewing all files use this key command within terminal to run program:
5. python ocr_handwriting.py --model handwriting.model --image images/hello_world.png
6. of course you can change file in command to any png(image) of your choosing but
7. it must be 28*28 pixels.
8. concepts covered: Machine Vision, Tensorflow, Gaussian Blurring, grayscale conversion and object recogintion techniques. 
9.
